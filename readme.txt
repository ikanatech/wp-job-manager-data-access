Free the data from wp-job-manager so we can do other things with it.

== Description ==
This plugin was created by combining methods from Astondify\'s Listify and Jobify Themes as a way to \"free\" the WP-Job-Manager data so that I could use FacetWP. I see though it should have several other uses, and I hope to improve upon it as I go. At this point this has been tested with SearchWP and FacetWP. It should also work with most other search plugins and I will be testing that over the next few weeks.

== Installation ==
1. Download the zip file
2. upload to your WordPress via plugin installer
3. Most plugins that you will be using this will simply need to call on \"jobs\" data in some cases it will showup as \"job_listings\"

== Changelog ==
0.0.2 - Corrected Errors: Changed top of plugin file, fixed line overrun from copy pasting from terminal
0.0.1 - Brand new plugin
